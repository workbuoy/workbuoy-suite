## PARALLEL EXECUTION STRATEGY - OPTIMIZED

### 🔴 CRITICAL PATH (Must be sequential):
**CHAT 1 → CHAT 2 → CHAT 6A**
- System integration (Core baseline + all modules) → Core modes foundation → Meta foundation
- Cannot parallelize - each depends on previous

### 🟡 PARALLEL TRACKS (Can run simultaneously after Chat 2):

**CORE UNDERSTANDING FOR ALL PARALLEL TRACKS:**
Each parallel track must understand WorkBuoy's complete architecture before implementation:
- Core = Foundation with 6 modes (Invisible→Tsunami) 
- Flex = Side-module for on-demand AI consulting (not built on Core, separate workflow)
- Secure = Side-module that adds compliance rails (no restrictions on Core/Flex, just additional safety)
- All modules share CXM data signals and Focus Card interface
- All modules can deliver professional artifacts and kits
- Meta capabilities apply across all modules

**TRACK A: Flex Module (Independent Implementation)** 
- CHAT 3 (Flex: Temp/Tempest) - Complete AI-vikar system independent of Core modes
- Integration point: Shares CXM data but separate workflow and UI entry points

**TRACK B: Role Intelligence & Automation**
- CHAT 4 (Role intelligence + Kraken playbooks) - Core mode enhancement + automation
- Can develop while Core modes are being tested and refined

**TRACK C: Value Validation & Delivery**
- CHAT 5C (Kit Value Validation) - Half-day validation before complex development
- CHAT 5A (Professional kits) - Deliverable system for all modules (Core, Flex, Secure)

### ⚡ SUPER-PARALLEL OPPORTUNITIES:

**Same Day Execution:**
- CHAT 3 + CHAT 4 (Flex + Role intelligence)
- CHAT 5C + CHAT 5A (Kit validation + Implementation)
- CHAT 6B + CHAT 7D (Documentation + Meta prototype)

**Two-Person Team Simulation:**
- **Person A**: Focuses on Core Product (Chats 3-4)
- **Person B**: Focuses on Value + Meta (Chats 5-6)
- Both work from same codebase, merge at integration windows

---

## WEEK 1: Foundation (Days 1-2) - CRITICAL PATH

### CHAT 1: Foundation Integration + All Modules Baseline
**Goal: Get existing code working together + prepare for Core/Flex/Secure**

#### Prompt 1A: System Analysis + Multi-Module Architecture
```
I'm developing WorkBuoy - a revolutionary AI work assistant with configurable proactivity levels and multiple operational modules.

WORKBUOY COMPLETE CONCEPT:
WorkBuoy consists of three parallel modules, all sharing the same CXM data foundation:

**CORE MODULE (6 proaktivitetsmodi):**
1. **Invisible** (0): Observes only, logs locally
2. **Calm** (1): Responds only when asked directly  
3. **Proactive** (2): Suggests via chips/nudges, never executes
4. **Ambitious** (3): Prepares drafts/templates, always preview-first
5. **Kraken** (4): API-driven, orchestrates data from external systems
6. **Tsunami** (5): Most proactive, can write back to systems (always with approval)

**FLEX MODULE (On-demand AI consultant):**
- **Temp**: Single-task AI assistant (draft email, clean Excel file)
- **Tempest**: Project-level AI consultant (full client proposal, market analysis)
- Activated via Command Palette or "Hire Flex" button
- Independent workflow from Core modes

**SECURE MODULE (Compliance-first variant):**
- Enhanced audit logging and data masking
- Stricter mode limitations (e.g., only Invisible-Proactive available)
- Enterprise/government compliance features
- No restrictions on Core/Flex - just additional safety rails

SHARED ARCHITECTURE:
Role Definition → CXM Data Signals → Focus Card Prioritization → Module Action → User Value

[UPLOAD: workbuoy.zip - current codebase if exists, or note "starting from scratch"]

TASK: Analyze current state and create SYSTEM_MAP.md showing:
1. How all three modules will share CXM data infrastructure
2. Tasks/Log buttons integration across modules
3. Current working components vs what needs building
4. Integration points between modules
5. Security baseline for all modules
6. Minimum viable workflow for each module type

Focus on UNDERSTANDING the complete system architecture first.
```

#### Prompt 1B: Core Integration Fix + Module Foundation
```
Using the SYSTEM_MAP.md analysis, fix critical integration issues and establish module foundations:

PRIORITY FIXES:
1. EventBus → CXM → Focus Card → Chat flow (Core module)
2. Module switching capability (Core/Flex/Secure selection)
3. Shared CXM data across all modules
4. Tasks/Log buttons work across all operational modes

MODULE FOUNDATIONS:
- core.config.json (6 modes configuration)
- flex.config.json (Temp/Tempest definitions)  
- secure.policy.json (compliance rules and mode restrictions)
- Shared CXM data layer accessible by all modules

CONSTRAINTS:
- Keep design LOCKED (86% width, 72vh panels, glass morphism)
- Don't add complex features yet - just foundations
- Focus on making basic inter-module switching work

TEST SCENARIO: User can switch between Core/Flex/Secure and see different UI/behavior patterns

Provide working module foundation files that integrate properly.
