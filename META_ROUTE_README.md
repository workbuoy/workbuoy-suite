# Meta Route Starter

This add-on layers a *meta foundation* on top of the finished product **without** touching runtime code.
- All meta jobs are **opt-in** via `workflow_dispatch` inputs.
- Scope limited to **docs/tests/scripts** by allowlist.
- Includes *docgen*, *planner*, *builder (proposal only)*, and *meta logs*.
